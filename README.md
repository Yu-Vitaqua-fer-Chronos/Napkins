# Napkins
Napkins is a library which has the goal to wrap Minecraft packets into Nim types! The `src/protocols` folder will
be filled with the `packet.json` files from
[PrismarineJS/minecraft-data](https://github.com/PrismarineJS/minecraft-data), and using wiki.vg as a guide for
creating the layouts of data structures, so we can have neat and tidy objects for each packet!

This will highly be geared for use with [Nimberite](https://github.com/Yu-Vitaqua-fer-Chronos/Nimberite)'s networking
plugins. In theory, this project will work for multiple Minecraft versions and won't require much work to maintain!

PRs are *very* welcome!
